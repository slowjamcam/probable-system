    This project was made over the span of about a couple of months, and time spent coding was about a week. There was a lot of research that went into this project.
    It is one of my most used projects, but there are more features that I want to implement!   <br>
    I am progressively researching into bettering the security of the project and the ease of use on the client's side.
